## 😃SNOW😃

### About
🎉🎉✨✨
As a student majoring in Computer Science and Technology, I wish to have a tech blog symbolizing myself in the Internet which is created by my own.
And another reason motivating me to finish the project is that I enjoy designing myself, even I'm not engaged in HTML/CSS and designing.

Although Snow is just a theme based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), but still is a step moving forward my little dream❤❤.


By the way, Snow does not mean Jon Snow, the King in the North, it represents purity and rarity.



### Usage
The way to config this theme can be found in ```_config.yml``` file, and demo is [here](https://itongworld.github.io/).
